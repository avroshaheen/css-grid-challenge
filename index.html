        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
      <p class="details">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        program gave me the
        confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
        standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
        and amazing people. ”</p>

      <p class="summary"> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </p>
      <p class="details">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals
        who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
        only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
        took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
